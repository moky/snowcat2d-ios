/** Scheduler is responsible of triggering the scheduled callbacks.
 You should not use NSTimer. Instead use this class.
 
 There are 2 different types of callbacks (selectors):
 
	- tick selector: the 'tick' selector will be called every frame. You can customize the priority.
	- custom selector: A custom selector will be called every frame, or with a custom interval of time
 
 The 'custom selectors' should be avoided when possible. It is faster, and consumes less memory to use the 'tick selector'.

 You can use this property to create a 'slow motion' or 'fast fordward' effect.
 Default is 1.0. To create a 'slow motion' effect, use values below 1.0.
 To create a 'fast fordward' effect, use values higher than 1.0.
