/** S2ActionManager is a singleton that manages all the actions.
 Normally you won't need to use this singleton directly. 99% of the cases you will use the S2Node interface,
 which uses this singleton.
 But there are some cases where you might need to use this singleton.
 Examples:
	- When you want to run an action where the target is different from a S2Node.
	- When you want to pause / resume the actions

 If the target is not present, a new instance of this target will be created either paused or paused, and the action will be added to the newly created target.
 When the target is paused, the queued actions won't be 'ticked'.
